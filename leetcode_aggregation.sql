-- +----------------+----------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
-- rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
-- Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
-- Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
SELECT id,movie,description,rating FROM Cinema WHERE id%2 != 0 AND description != "boring" ORDER BY (rating) DESC;

-- Table: Prices
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | product_id    | int     |
-- | start_date    | date    |
-- | end_date      | date    |
-- | price         | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
-- For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
-- Table: UnitsSold
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | product_id    | int     |
-- | purchase_date | date    |
-- | units         | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- This table may contain duplicate rows.
-- Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
-- Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
SELECT 
    p.product_id, 
    COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices p
LEFT JOIN 
    UnitsSold u 
ON 
    p.product_id = u.product_id 
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id;

-- Table: Project
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | project_id  | int     |
-- | employee_id | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- (project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
-- employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
-- Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
-- Table: Employee
-- +------------------+---------+
-- | Column Name      | Type    |
-- +------------------+---------+
-- | employee_id      | int     |
-- | name             | varchar |
-- | experience_years | int     |
-- +------------------+---------+
-- employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
-- Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
-- Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years FROM Project AS p INNER JOIN Employee AS e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id GROUP BY p.project_id;

-- Table: Users
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | user_id     | int     |
-- | user_name   | varchar |

-- user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
-- Table: Register
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | contest_id  | int     |
-- | user_id     | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- (contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
-- Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
-- Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.
SELECT contest_id,ROUND(COUNT(user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage FROM Register GROUP BY contest_id ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;\

-- Table: Queries
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | query_name  | varchar |
-- | result      | varchar |
-- | position    | int     |
-- | rating      | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- This table may have duplicate rows.
-- This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
-- The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
-- The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
-- We define query quality as:
-- The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
-- We also define poor query percentage as:
-- The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
-- Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
-- Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
SELECT query_name,  ROUND(SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(*),2)AS quality,ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*))*100,2) AS poor_query_percentage FROM Queries WHERE query_name IS NOT NULL GROUP BY query_name;
