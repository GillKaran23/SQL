-- Table: Employees
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | Column Name | Type     |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | employee_id | int      |
-- | name        | varchar  |
-- | manager_id  | int      |
-- | salary      | int      |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
-- Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
SELECT employee_id FROM Employees WHERE manager_id NOT IN(SELECT employee_id FROM Employees) AND salary<30000 ORDER BY employee_id;

-- Table: Seat
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | student     | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
-- id is a continuous increment.
-- Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
-- Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.
SELECT ( CASE
            WHEN id%2 != 0 AND id != counts THEN id+1
            WHEN id%2 != 0 AND id = counts THEN id
            ELSE id-1
        END) AS id, student

-- Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
-- Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.

-- +---------------+---------+
-- In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
-- visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
-- amount is the total paid by a customer.
-- You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).
-- Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
-- Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.
