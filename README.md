# SQL Practice Repository

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! This is where I document my journey of improving my SQL skills by solving daily challenges on HackerRank and Leetcode.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Improve my SQL skills.
- Solve at least one SQL question daily from both HackerRank and Leetcode.
- Track my progress and keep a record of the solutions.
